# EECS4315-MissionCriticalSystems
This course is a sequel to System Specification (EECS3342) which is an introduction to mathematical modeling and refinement of systems using deductive methods.  This course provides a deeper understanding of both deductive and algorithmic methods and tools for ensuring the safety and correctness of mission critical systems (e.g. medical devices such as pacemakers, nuclear reactors and train control systems). In addition to deductive techniques, the course treats algorithmic methods such as model-checking tools, specification languages such as temporal logic, table based specification methods, and the nature of software certification.
